The rolls of paper on the desk fall onto the floor, scattering as the aircraft continues to wobble. The control panel dials spin in wild directions, lights flashing as you hold on tightly to your seat. 
The starlight blinds you as you wince at its brightness, thanking the tinted viewpanel of your helmet. This was supposed to be another expedition to Mars, what went wrong?
You glance sideways and notice your backpack.
:
1 Grab the backpack...|
Letting one hand go, you grab onto the backpack seconds before it hits the control panel. 
You feel your muscles scream in pain as you try to pull yourself back onto the seat. 
:
1 Hold on...|
You adjust your grip on the seat, but your pinky jams into the side of the metallic arm rest. You let go in pain and close your eyes, ready to embrace the impact of hitting the aircraft walls. 
:
1 Ow, that sort of hurts...|
You open your eyes and you notice your surroundings. 
:
1 What happened?|
Engine oil rolls down the cold metallic boards, the air dead with silence.
Your entire body feels sore, but the view in front of you is worse. 
:
1  My space ship...|
Dust from outside blows in and the metal boards creak under the breeze. You look around yourself and notice that the air bags were triggered, easing the impact. 
:
1 It seems like I crashed onto some planet with no atmosphere...|
:
1 Let's explore.|
You get up, reaching over to the food pack that lay on its side. Your hands almost reach the pack when a thin, wine red arm swings through the aircraft boards and snatch it away from you. 
:
1 What was that? It was… scaly.|
You hide in the dark as you peek through the metal boards. 
The organism has its back to you, giving you a view of its short but curly tail. It pours the water out of the bottle in the food back, splattering the liquid over the rocks on the ground. It goes for the freeze dried berries next, ripping open its packaging and stuffing it's arms into it. 
The batteries of the food pack pops out from the package, rolling towards you.
:
1 Wait a little longer.|
You jump at the loud clang the boards make when the aircraft door breaks off, screeching as it drags along the floor for a while. The disturbing noises don't seem to bother the organism at all, almost as if it's deaf.
:
1 Wait, it's gone?|
You sigh as you open your backpack, assembling the ore detector machine. Maybe this could be useful. After all, the bulb on the tail of the organism seems to glow. 
:
1 There must be a cave somewhere.|
You peek through the metallic boards that kept you in the dark, surveying the surroundings. 
:
1  Now, let's actually explore.|
You take a survey of your surroundings. 
:
1 The Moon?|
No, the mountainous terrain doesn't fit the craters that decorate such rock. It's almost like a gray Mars. 
On the dusty ground, you notice there's footprints. 
More specifically, footprints that appear to match the organism that raided your final pack of food.
Your machine starts to beep, indicating some sort of recognizable ore is nearby. 
:
1 Follow the footprints
The footprints were rather small for an organism twice your size; they were similar to wine coloured horses from your home planet. The tiny footprints led to a cave, its gaping hole littered with luminescent ores.
: 
1 Scan the ores.|
Hm, it seems like it doesn’t recognize it. You take a small chunk that lay on the side in your hands, using it to guide you in the dark.
You grip your machine tightly as you walk in, ready to face what’s ahead. If the organism attacks you, you can aim for its huge eyeball. It’ll be easy, right?
1 Continue walking.|
The further down you go, the more you start to doubt your choices. Seriously, what were you thinking? You’re on an unknown planet, chasing after the thief that took your last portions of food. That organism could easily pull out some sci-fi movie move and say, telepathically control you.
:
1 Continue walking.|
Who knows, these glowing ores aren’t even known to humankind so far. For all you know, it could be radioactive, slowly seeping into your bones and destroying your tissues...
:
1 Continue walking.|
You hit something. It’s kind of scaly, a little soft and a tad bit…. Alive.
:
1 Look up.|
A singular, lime green eye stares back at you. It’s ginormous, daunting and rather disturbing.
:
1 Poke its eye!|
You try to move, but you can’t; your entire body is frozen in fear. 
The chunk of ore in your hands tumble onto the ground. You curse internally as you watch it roll and hit the organism’s skinny legs. 
You watch the organism’s eyes survey the crystal for a second. Then, it stretches its arm over to you, pointing downwards at the crystal.
:
1  Is it… asking for something?|
It tilts its head a little, pointing at the crystal again. It raises its four fingers up before pointing back down at the crystal.
:
1 It wants 4 luminous crystals.|
You slowly take a few steps back from the organism, making sure to never give your back to it. The organism’s eye follows you as you go, picking up smaller ores that were broken already.
: 
1 Place it in front of the organism.|
The organism gives you a small thumbs up. The little light bulb on its tail wagged like a dog’s, as if it’s happy. It takes the four crystal ores and drops your food packet onto the ground.
:
1  It’s completely ransacked, but at least it’s not broken.|
:
1 For an organism with a huge eye, it sure left the freeze dried ice cream alone...|
You wonder if it’s lactose intolerant. Laughing dryly at your own joke, you notice the organism beckoning you to follow it from afar.
Up ahead, you see light, as if you’re back aboveground.
