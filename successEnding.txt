You head back to the control panel and watch it light up. Everything’s good to go, all you need to do is leave now.
:
1 NOMIA, are you coming?|
The robot floats up to you and rests on your hand. 
“I’m not sure. Do you know this name?”
It turns around and you see the NOKIA engraving. Below it is a small name infamous to you.
However, he died in the 1500’s, how was NOMIA able to stay working?
:
1 Recall a guitar performance.|
Oh, right. That one tone based off of Gran Vals, used by every “retro” flip phone owner back at home.
The one that blasts off of every NOKIA phone. The company was said to have started up in 1860’s or so as a paper mill, which could line up with NOMIA’s data. Perhaps the owners had connections, and NOMIA was passed on from owner to owner.
:
1 Yes.|
“That’s great! Can I see him again, if I go back home with you?”
You look at the robot. It’s rather eager, almost mimicking a puppy.
:
1 I don’t think I’ll be able to find him.|
You can already feel the dread of showing the robot his grave, which rested in a chapel.
“How could you not find Leonardo da Vinci? Wouldn’t he be under the service of the French King?”
:
1 He’s always busy, I wouldn’t dare interrupt his projects.|
You pat NOMIA’s head and you watch the robot bobble up and down, mimicking a nod.
“Makes sense. I think I will stay here then, with the Questers. REQUY will hate to see me leave without them.”
:
1 Alright.|
You open the aircraft door and let the robot out, watching it float to REQUY’s side.
:
1 Well, I guess this is a goodbye, NOMIA, REQUY.|
