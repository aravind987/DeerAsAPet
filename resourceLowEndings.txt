You went to repair the spaceship for a while with NOMIA.
During the entire time, you felt your head hurt and the world getting a little hazy. However, you brushed it off and assumed it was because of the rather unenjoyable dinner you had last night.
You kept on pushing through, but now as you leave the spaceship, you stumble over its steps.
You land on the ground with a thud.
:
1 Try to get up.|
It’s not working, but you manage to reach your hand out to NOMIA.
:
1 NOMIA...|
The robot looks back at you.
“Are you hurt? Hungry? Thirsty? Tired?”
Its words start blending together and you blink your heavy eyelids.
:
1 I don’t know what you’re saying...|
You close your eyes, resting your head on the dusty terrain.
:
1 NOMIA…. I can’t keep going.|
:
1 I’m tired.|
