You start up the rocket, taking off your helmet. The oxygen tank should be working by now, just in time before your mini packs ran out. 
You check the various controls, listening for any leaks when you notice an audible gas leak.

1 Check the oxygen tank.|
Hurriedly, you run over to the tank. A dent on the bottom of the tank sustained a puncture. Perhaps it was from the stalagmites, or you overexerting yourself. 
In a frantic hurry, you rush to find your helmet.

You grab your helmet and stuff it on, opening the spaceship's door. You have to tell the robot to make a new aluminum tank. 
You notice a white blob pop up from the far end of the field, exiting the cave. 
You hobble out and realize you forgot your oxygen tanks. 
Everything's suddenly hot, tight and even â€¦ tiring.
